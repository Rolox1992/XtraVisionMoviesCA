# XtraVisionMoviesCA
Xtra-vision is a software system that is inside a Video rental kiosk. The Kiosk is placed in the lobby of 
shopping centres and grocery stores throughout Ireland. The kiosk allows customers to rent movies.
Details of this system are available here at this link: https://xtra-vision.ie/how-it-works/
The Xtra-Vision company has signed a contract with your team to design and write the software for
this Kiosk. You will be combining skills from two of the classes that you have this semester, to design
and implement a Java program that will provide all of the functionality of the system described in the
link above.
